# Weather-Dashboard

The weather dashboard has been developed using Openweather Map third-party APIs by accessing their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. D

I used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. 
The coding bootcamp challenge#6 involved creating a dashboard whihc provides weather conditions for various cities by entering the city name in the search field. Users have to enter a city name and it will search for and match the closest city. This weather dashboard also provides current conditions in addition to a future 5-day forecast. There is pop-up alert provided to the user in the event if the city name could not be found. The names of cities searched are stored in a list on the left side. In addition as the user searches more cities, they will get added to the list. Users are able to click cities that appear on the list and toggle between them.
